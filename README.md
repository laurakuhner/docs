### AppThwack ####

### Ruby Coding Style ##
We follow the coding style conventions documented in this [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

All contributors are responsible for being familiar with these guidelines and adhering to them. The code you write will be maintained by others, please be a good citizen and follow good coding style. You'll be more likely to be invited to future automation cycles for doing so.

In order to ensure that code adheres to the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide), we use the Ruby static code analyze [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop). It will enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community Ruby Style Guide.
